Academic Work
========

These are academic projects from the time I was getting "educated".
These projects were done in group with various colleagues and so I don't want to take full credits.
Almost everything was written in C and the quality of the code varies greatly.

The main purpose of having all this old code here is to serve as a personal reference for the good and the bad practices of programming.
